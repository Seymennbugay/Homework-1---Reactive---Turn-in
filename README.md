I transitioned my existing SportsCenter project to be React-based. Originally, it was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, I attempted to deploy it using React. I divided the project into components and learned about the importance of file path extensions in React, the useState hook, and integrating basic JavaScript functions and JSX into my components.
